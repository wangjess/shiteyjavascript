# Bonus Features:
- Added a toggle sound effects audio button in the settings panel. The sound effects are default set to FALSE upon game start.
- Added a sound effect for when the user collects a candy or bead. It sounds like "blip"!
- Added cheering audio that plays for a few seconds after the splash screen goes away! :D
