# Bonus Features:
- Added a toggle sound effects audio button in the settings panel. The sound effects are default set to FALSE upon game start. Users can turn them on to get a sound effect when the user collects a candy or bead.
- Added a sound effect for when the user collects a candy or bead. It sounds like "blip"!
- Added cheering audio that plays for a few seconds after the splash screen goes away! :D (This is not affected by the "toggle sound effects audio button". It always plays upon game start.)
